/// Describes how a value travels from one point to another over time.
///
/// A [CueMotion] is a **description**, not a running animation. It holds the
/// parameters (duration, curve, spring config, etc.) and produces a
/// [CueSimulation] on demand via [build]. The simulation is what actually
/// drives the value forward — [CueMotion] only describes the rules.
/// [build] receives the runtime context — direction, start value, end value,
/// velocity, and so on.
///
/// ## Duration and partial travel
///
/// [baseDuration] always represents the **full 0→1 reference duration**.
/// It is a nominal value — the actual playback time lives on the
/// [CueSimulation] produced by [build], as [CueSimulation.duration].
/// That value is computed dynamically from [SimulationBuildData]: timed
/// motions scale it by `|endValue - startValue|`, spring motions derive it
/// from physics given the start/end/velocity. Either way, the simulation
/// knows its own real duration once built.
///
/// ## Phases
///
/// Most motions have a single phase ([totalPhases] == 1). Composite motions
/// declare multiple phases — Cue builds one simulation with the initial phase
/// via [build], and the simulation itself advances through remaining phases
/// internally as each one completes.
///
/// ## Built-in presets
///
/// [CueMotion] groups its factory constructors into three families:
///
/// - **Timed** — fixed-duration curve-based motions:
///   [CueMotion.linear], [CueMotion.curved], [CueMotion.easeIn],
///   [CueMotion.easeOut], [CueMotion.easeInOut], and variants.
/// - **Spring presets** — physics-driven motions with sensible defaults:
///   [CueMotion.smooth], [CueMotion.bouncy], [CueMotion.snappy], and others.
/// - **Custom spring** — [CueMotion.spring] accepts a `duration` and `bounce`
///   to describe a spring without picking a named preset.
///
/// All constructors are designed for shorthand dot syntax when the type is
/// already inferred — e.g. `motion: .smooth()`, `motion: .linear(200.ms)`.
