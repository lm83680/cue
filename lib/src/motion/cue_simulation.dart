/// This mixin adds two key features to Flutter's `Simulation` base class:
/// - **Phasing**: Supports multi-phase animations where different transforms
///   can occur at different times within a single animation lifecycle.
///   Mainly used for keyframe-based motions.
/// - **Progress-based sampling**: The [valueAtProgress] method allows querying
///   the animation value at any normalized 0→1 progress point, independent of
///   internal time dynamics. This is essential for scrubbing, interrupted
///   animations, and timeline-based layouts.
///
/// Standard [Simulation] methods (`x`, `dx`, `isDone`) remain driven by actual
/// elapsed time `t` in seconds. Implementations should ensure both time-based
/// and progress-based queries remain consistent.

  ///   has actual duration = 200 ms × 0.5 = 100 ms.
  ///
  /// - **Spring** ([CueSpringSimulation]): Computed dynamically by numerically
  ///   integrating the spring physics until settlement within [Simulation.tolerance].
  ///   Different start/end values and velocities yield different durations.
